# AI-game-bot
This project is an interactive game bot built using Pygame, offering a selection of classic games for the user to enjoy. The bot presents a menu that lets you choose from the following games:

- Pong: The classic paddle-and-ball game where you compete against an AI opponent.
- Maze: Navigate through complex mazes and find your way to the exit.
- Snake: Guide the snake to eat food and grow, but avoid crashing into walls or yourself.
- Breakout: Control the paddle to break all the bricks with a bouncing ball.
- Flappy Bird: Fly through obstacles by tapping the spacebar, trying not to hit anything.
- Space Shooter: Take control of a spaceship and defend against waves of enemy invaders.
